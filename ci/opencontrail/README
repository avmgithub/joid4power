OpenContrail Deployment with Juju
=================================

This readme contains instructions for checking out and deploying Juju charms for
OpenContrail.

The charms are targetted at Trusty but originally used OpenContrail Precise
packages.


Checkout charms
---------------

Charms are hosted on Launchpad.
You need to 'sudo apt-get install bzr' first.

Follow these steps to checkout code:

cd <deployer dir>
./fetch-charms.sh

This will checkout the relevant charms into 'src' and create any Juju symlinks
in 'charms'.


Deploy with cloud-sh-contrail
-----------------------------

cloud-sh-contrail is a collection of development shell scripts to deploy
and setup OpenStack with OpenContrail using Juju's local provider. This will
create 3 KVMs as follows:

*KVM #1 - Keystone, Glance, Neutron Server, Nova Cloud Controller, Horizon,
          MySQL, RabbitMQ, Contrail Configuration, Contrail Control,
          Contrail Analytics, Contrail Web UI, Zookeeper

*KVM #2 - Nova Compute with Contrail vRouter

*KVM #3 - Cassandra

You'll require approx. 25Gb RAM with 60Gb+ disk space.
Deployment can take anywhere between 20 mins to 1 hour.

You need to 'sudo apt-get install juju juju-local uvtool', and
logout/login in order to pick up libvirt group permissions before
proceeding. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1308088.

Follow these steps:

ssh-keygen
  (if you don't already have a key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa).

cp cloud-sh-contrail/environments.yaml ~/.juju
  (or create your own default local environment in your existing
   environments.yaml file)

cd cloud-sh-contrail

./deploy-trusty.sh (deploys under trusty)
or
./deploy-precise.sh (deploys under precise)

This will log to 'out.log'.

This will deploy OpenStack and import Trusty's daily image into Glance.

Horizon will be located on the machine 'juju status openstack-dashboard' -
http://<ip>/horizon.

Contrail Web UI will be located on the machine 'juju status contrail-webui' -
http://<ip>:8080.

Admin credentials will be written to cloud/admin-openrc.

Upon deployment, the host's route and iptables config will be updated to send
NAT'ed traffic to the Nova Compute node hosting Contrail's virtual gateway.
Such changes can be disabled by not defining or commenting out the variable
'CONFIGURE_HOST_ROUTING' in cloud-sh-contrail/config-*.sh.

The deployment can be destroyed with:

juju destroy-environment local


Deploy with Juju Deployer
-------------------------

Juju Deployer can deploy a preset configuration of charms given a yaml
configuration file. There is a configuration file in
'juju-deployer/contrail.yaml'.

You need to 'sudo apt-get install juju-deployer' first.

Then:

cd juju-deployer

juju-deployer -c contrail.yaml -d trusty-icehouse-contrail (deploy trusty)
or
juju-deployer -c contrail.yaml -d precise-icehouse-contrail (deploy precise)

Juju Deployer will branch its own copy of the remote charms.

Post-deployment scripts exist to configure OpenStack.
You will need 'dnsutils' package installed beforehand.
To run:

cd scripts

CONFIGURE_HOST_ROUTING=true ./openstack.sh

Setting 'CONFIGURE_HOST_ROUTING' environment variable will configure the host's
route and iptables config to send NAT'ed traffic to the Nova Compute node
hosting Contrail's virtual gateway. If you do not want this, run
'./openstack.sh' directly.
